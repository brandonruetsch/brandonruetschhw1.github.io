            <img src="assests/images/Profpicture.jpg" class="profpic" alt="Brandon Ruetsch"

            <p>This is the start of my bio. A very long bio as a matter of fact. So long in fact I don't know if I should even bother to begin telling my story. So I won't because we would be wasting eachothers time by reading this, which is exactly what I am trying to do"</p>

            <p>Again here is another section where I could utilize this space to tell you a bit about myself but to have a WHOLE webpage deticated just to me is already more than I could ever dream and for that fact I am speechless and can't go on with typing</p>

            <p>Here I am again! one last time for the sake of this assignment and I gotta tell ya, I think I am finally ready to talk about myself. But wait my mom is calling for dinner, I must go now. BYE!</p>
